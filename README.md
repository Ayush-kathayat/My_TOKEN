Token Contract

The Token contract is a basic implementation of an Ethereum-based token. It allows for the creation, management, and destruction of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract provides functionalities for minting new tokens, burning existing tokens, and keeping track of token balances for different addresses.

Overview

The contract includes the following key features:

 1. Public variables: The contract stores essential details about the token, such as the token name, abbreviation (symbol), and the total supply of tokens.

 2. Mapping of addresses to balances: The contract maintains a mapping that associates Ethereum addresses with their respective token balances.

 3. Mint function: The contract includes a mint function that enables the creation of new tokens. By providing an address and a value, the total supply is increased by the specified amount, and the balance of the given address is incremented accordingly.

 4. Burn function: The contract also provides a burn function to destroy existing tokens. By specifying an address and a value, the total supply is reduced by the specified amount, and the balance of the address is decremented accordingly. The function includes conditionals to ensure that the balance of the account is greater than or equal to the amount being burned.

This Token contract serves as a foundational building block for creating and managing custom tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be utilized for various purposes such as implementing decentralized applications (DApps), conducting token sales, or facilitating tokenized ecosystems.
